This app takes your body movements and translates them into inputs on your computer.

First connect your Kinect to your computer with USB and stand 2m away from the camera. After that start up digital twins.

Lift either hand above your head and you will move forward (w).
Extend your left hand to the left and you will turn left.
Extend your left hand to the right and you will turn right.

This app uses a .exe file to translate the commands to raw mouse delta data for windows.This makes it possible for the cursor to move in unity despite the CursorMoveLock being turned on.
